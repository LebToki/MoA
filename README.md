## Overview

The MoA Grog Chatbot leverages a powerful combination of open-source models to generate high-quality responses, ensuring both accuracy and relevance. This repository includes essential modifications to enable the MoA Chatbot to work seamlessly with Groq, resulting in incredibly fast local LLM inference.

In addition to the core functionality, we've integrated a user-friendly web-based interface, replacing the previous command-line interaction. This interface provides a more accessible and visually appealing way to engage with the chatbot. While the current design serves as a proof of concept, demonstrating the chatbot's capabilities effectively, there is ample room for further styling and enhancements to refine the user experience.

- **Model Selection**: Choose the model you want to use from the dropdown menu. The default model is `llama3-70b-8192`, which balances performance and speed.
  
- **Temperature Control**: Adjust the temperature setting to control the randomness and creativity of the chatbot's responses. The default value is `0.7`, providing a good balance between deterministic and varied outputs.
  
- **Max Tokens**: Define the maximum number of tokens (words or characters) for the response. The default is `2048`, which ensures comprehensive answers without overwhelming verbosity.
  
- **Create Your Topics**: Easily create new conversation topics by entering your desired topic names in the text field provided. This helps organize your interactions and revisit previous conversations.
  
- **Choose Your Topic**: Select a topic by clicking on it in the sidebar. The chat interface will load on the right, allowing you to continue your discussion seamlessly.
  
- **Instruction Input**: Enter your prompt or instruction in the text area. This is where you ask questions or provide commands to the chatbot.
  
- **Theme Toggle**: Enhance your user experience by switching between light and dark modes. Use the "Switch to Dark Mode" button to toggle themes based on your preference.
  
- **Submit and View Responses**: After filling in the necessary fields, submit the form to receive a response from the MoA Grog Chatbot. The response will be displayed on the same page, within the chat interface.

### Additional Features

- **Create New Conversations**: Use the sidebar to create new conversation topics, helping you manage different discussions effectively.

- **Refine the styling**: With the latest Bootstrap and jQuery, we have room to enhance the UI/UX further.
- **Chronological ordering**: Move recent chats to the top (DESC order) to cut down on scrolling.
- **Further enhancement of the output**: Currently, not much has been implemented to control the output except basic styling. This is an area to be worked on based on various use cases.
